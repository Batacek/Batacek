# Batacek

My name is Thomas, and I am a computer programmer. I have a basic understanding of the Python, C#, Batch, PHP, HTML, and CSS programming languages. 
I have experience with the Raspberry Pi and Arduino microcontrollers, and I intend to publish some of my RPI codes. I have obtained an ITE7 certificate, and I will soon receive a CCNA1 and PE1 certification.
